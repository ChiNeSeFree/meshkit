This is a rewrite of the imagebuilder [1] used to build firmware images for wireless community networks. It is a application to be used together with web2py [2]. Just drop this app in the applications folder of web2py and edit the model 0.py to fit your needs/environment. All variables that are only used by meshkit are prefixed with config_
